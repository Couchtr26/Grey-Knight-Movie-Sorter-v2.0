Thank you for using Grey Knight Software.

Every tool we make is a fusion of code and memory. This one includes something deeper—what we call The John Code. It's a memorial written in rhythm and rules. It’s not just nostalgia. It’s defiance in function. It means something.

If this helped you, we only ask one thing:
Let someone else know about it.

– You are not forgotten, John.
– You are not alone, user.
– You are not done, builder.

Goo goo g'joob.
